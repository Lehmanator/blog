# Emanote Template

This is a Git template repository of Markdown notes that are automatically rendered using [Emanote] and hosted on [[GitHub Pages]], while enabling editing in the likes of [Visual Studio Code](https://emanote.srid.ca/start/resources/editors/vscode). For details, see https://github.com/srid/emanote-template.

Any `.md` file (eg: [[GitHub Pages]]) or directory of `.md` files (eg: [[Tutorials]]) you add to the repository will be rendered automatically. For information on all features Emanote supports, see https://emanote.srid.ca/
